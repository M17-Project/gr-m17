## Compiling for GNU Radio

The default targetted version is GNU Radio 3.10 (``main`` branch). Tested on Debian/GNU Linux sid with GNU Radio 
3.10.10.0 (Python 3.11.9) and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with GNU Radio 3.10.9.2, assuming the following dependencies are installed:

```
sudo apt install git cmake build-essential doxygen gnuradio
```

For compiling ``gr-m17``:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/M17-Project/gr-m17
cd gr-m17
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j`nproc`
sudo make install
```

will finish with a statement such as
```
-- Set runtime path of "/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/gnuradio/m17/m17_python.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so" to ""
```
Depending on Linux distribution, variables might have to be set (tested with Debian/sid, but not needed with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS) 
to help GNU Radio Companion find the Python libraries:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/
```

where the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` setting results from

```
find /usr/local/ -name libgnuradio-m17.so.1.0.0 -print
```

to solve any issue related to ``ImportError: libgnuradio-m17.so.1.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory``
(which means that ``/usr/local`` is not part of the GNU Radio Companion paths)

When running the flowgraph found in ``examples`` with ``gnuradio-companion ../examples/m17_loopback.grc``

See <a href="examples/README.md">examples/README.md</a> for the expected output and unit testing examples.

Notice that due to the verbose output of ``gr-m17`` and the slow console of GNU Radio Companion, I 
would strongly advise generating the Python script from GNU Radio Companion and then execute 
``python3 m17_loopback.py`` from a terminal to avoid waiting for a long time for GNU Radio 
Companion to flush all messages.

## About the Meta field

The Meta field in the M17 Encoder can be of two types:
* an ASCII string, maximum 14-character long, if ``Encr. Type`` is set to ``None`` and if ``Encr. Subtype`` is set to ``Text``
* a byte array otherwise. In case of a byte array, in order to be compatible with Python string encoding as UTF-8, the ``std::string`` read
by M17 Encoder is expected to be UTF-8 encoded. This is important if using ``gr-m17`` outside from GNU Radio Companion but directly linked
from a C++ application. From Python, the UTF-8 byte array is generated with e.g. ``'\x00\x00\x65\x41\xB0\x93\x02\x44\xE2\x47\x29\x77\x00\x00'`` (notice
the single or double quote around the byte array definition) in the M17 Encoder Meta field.

## Developer Notes

### GNU Radio Module Bindings

**Warning**: The default gr_modtool output informs GNU Radio Companion to import m17 rather than from gnuradio import m17. This has to be changed in the YML files manually as the template is erroneous.

### Python Bindings Synchronization

In case of error related to Python bindings for m17_coder.h are out of sync after changing header files in include/gnuradio/m17, make sure that:

```bash
md5sum include/gnuradio/m17/m17_decoder.h
```

match the information in python/m17/bindings/*cc.

Rather than manually changing the md5sum, the proper way of handling bindings in the Python directory is to execute:

```bash
gr_modtool bind m17_decoder
gr_modtool bind m17_coder
```

from the gr-m17 directory, assuming gr_modtool bind works, otherwise check gnuradio/gnuradio#6477

### Coder Block Implementation

The coder block is an interpolating block outputting 24 more times samples than input symbols. The (well named) noutput_items is the output buffer size which fills much faster than the input stream so we fill out until noutput_items are reached, then send this to the GNU Radio scheduler, and consume the few input samples needed to fill the output buffer. The ring buffer mechanism of GNU Radio makes sure the dataflow is consistent.

## TODO

The 3.8 version is probably broken and for sure is not using ``libm17``: should be updated upon request

Old README section about 3.8: 
```
For GNU Radio 3.8, insert ``git checkout 3.8`` after the ``git clone ...`` command and check the 3.8 branch
version of the README.md for ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``PYTHONPATH`` tested on Debian/stable.
```
