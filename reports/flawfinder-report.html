  The options cover various aspects of flawfinder as follows.

  Documentation:
  --help | -h Show this usage help.
  --version   Show version number.
  --listrules List the rules in the ruleset (rule database).

  Selecting Input Data:
  --allowlink Allow symbolic links.
  --followdotdir
              Follow directories whose names begin with ".".
              Normally they are ignored.
  --nolink    Skip symbolic links (ignored).
  --patch F | -P F
              Display information related to the patch F
              (patch must be already applied).

  Selecting Hits to Display:
  --inputs | -I
              Show only functions that obtain data from outside the program;
              this also sets minlevel to 0.
  -m X | --minlevel=X
              Set minimum risk level to X for inclusion in hitlist.  This
              can be from 0 (``no risk'')  to  5  (``maximum  risk'');  the
              default is 1.
  --falsepositive | -F
              Do not include hits that are likely to be false  positives.
              Currently,  this  means  that function names are ignored if
              they're not followed by "(", and that declarations of char-
              acter  arrays  aren't noted.  Thus, if you have use a vari-
              able named "access" everywhere, this will eliminate  refer-
              ences  to  this ordinary variable.  This isn't the default,
              because this  also  increases  the  likelihood  of  missing
              important  hits;  in  particular, function names in #define
              clauses and calls through function pointers will be missed.
  --neverignore | -n
              Never ignore security issues, even if they have an ``ignore''
              directive in a comment.
  --regex PATTERN | -e PATTERN
              Only report hits that match the regular expression PATTERN.

  Selecting Output Format:
  --columns | -C
              Show  the  column  number  (as well as the file name and
              line number) of each hit; this is shown after the line number
              by adding a colon and the column number in the line (the first
              character in a line is column number 1).
  --context | -c
              Show context (the line having the "hit"/potential flaw)
  --dataonly | -D
              Don't display the headers and footers of the analysis;
              use this along with --quiet to get just the results.
  --html | -H
              Display as HTML output.
  --immediate | -i
              Immediately display hits (don't just wait until the end).
  --sarif     Generate output in SARIF format.
  --singleline | -S
              Single-line output.
  --omittime  Omit time to run.
  --quiet | -Q
              Don't display status information (i.e., which files are being
              examined) while the analysis is going on.
  --error-level=LEVEL
              Return a nonzero (false) error code if there is at least one
              hit of LEVEL or higher.  If a diffhitlist is provided,
              hits noted in it are ignored.
              This option can be useful within a continuous integration script,
              especially if you mark known-okay lines as "flawfinder: ignore".
              Usually you want level to be fairly high, such as 4 or 5.
              By default, flawfinder returns 0 (true) on a successful run.

  Hitlist Management:
  --savehitlist=F
              Save all hits (the "hitlist") to F.
  --loadhitlist=F
              Load hits from F instead of analyzing source programs.
  --diffhitlist=F
              Show only hits (loaded or analyzed) not in F.
